I have created a small project using real data that I’ve compiled from my job. The data set used covers a 4-year period, from the start of 2019 to the end of 2022. For this particular time period, there are over 70,000 rows of data across several sheets and tables. The data consists of product/service order information from clients of our company, and contains data entries such as the client’s name, order ID, the product/service, and date of request and date of delivery.
The data set has been modified to remove sensitive information.

Please see the accompanying PDF file in this repository for the full breakdown.
